<h2>
    Cocoa and Chocolate
</h2>

<p>
    The term "Cocoa," a corruption of "Cacao," is almost universally used in
    English-speaking countries to designate the seeds of the small tropical
    tree known to botanists as THEOBROMA CACAO, from which a great variety
    of preparations under the name of cocoa and chocolate for eating and
    drinking are made. The name "Chocolatl" is nearly the same in most
    European languages, and is taken from the Mexican name of the drink,
    "Chocolate" or "Cacahuatl." The Spaniards found chocolate in common use
    among the Mexicans at the time of the invasion under Cortez in 1519, and
    it was introduced into Spain immediately after. The Mexicans not only
    used chocolate as a staple article of food, but they used the seeds of
    the cacao tree as a medium of exchange.
</p>

<p>
    No better evidence could be offered of the great advance which has been
    made in recent years in the knowledge of dietetics than the remarkable
    increase in the consumption of cocoa and chocolate in this country. The
    amount retained for home consumption in 1860 was only 1,181,054
    pounds&mdash;about 3-5 of an ounce for each inhabitant. The amount retained
    for home consumption for the year ending Dec. 31, 1908, was 93,956,721
    pounds&mdash;over 16 ounces for each inhabitant.
</p>

<p>
    Although there was a marked increase in the consumption of tea and
    coffee during the same period, the ratio of increase fell far below that
    of cocoa. It is evident that the coming American is going to be less of
    a tea and coffee drinker, and more of a cocoa and chocolate drinker.
    This is the natural result of a better knowledge of the laws of health,
    and of the food value of a beverage which nourishes the body while it
    also stimulates the brain.
</p>

<p>
    Baron von Liebig, one of the best-known writers on dietetics, says:
</p>

<p>
    "It is a perfect food, as wholesome as delicious, a beneficient restorer
    of exhausted power; but its quality must be good and it must be
    carefully prepared. It is highly nourishing and easily digested, and is
    fitted to repair wasted strength, preserve health, and prolong life. It
    agrees with dry temperaments and convalescents; with mothers who nurse
    their children; with those whose occupations oblige them to undergo
    severe mental strains; with public speakers, and with all those who give
    to work a portion of the time needed for sleep. It soothes both stomach
    and brain, and for this reason, as well as for others, it is the best
    friend of those engaged in literary pursuits."
</p>

<p>
    M. Brillat-Savarin, in his entertaining and valuable work, <i>Physiologie
    du Goût</i>, says: "Chocolate came over the mountains [from Spain to
    France] with Anne of Austria, daughter of Philip III and queen of Louis
    XIII. The Spanish monks also spread the knowledge of it by the presents
    they made to their brothers in France. It is well known that Linnæus
    called the fruit of the cocoa tree <i>theobroma</i>, 'food for the gods.' The
    cause of this emphatic qualification has been sought, and attributed by
    some to the fact that he was extravagantly fond of chocolate; by others
    to his desire to please his confessor; and by others to his gallantry, a
    queen having first introduced it into France.
</p>

<p>
    "The Spanish ladies of the New World, it is said, carried their love for
    chocolate to such a degree that, not content with partaking of it
    several times a day, they had it sometimes carried after them to church.
    This favoring of the senses often drew upon them the censures of the
    bishop; but the Reverend Father Escobar, whose metaphysics were as
    subtle as his morality was accommodating, declared, formally, that a
    fast was not broken by chocolate prepared with water; thus wire-drawing,
    in favor of his penitents, the ancient adage, '<i>Liquidum non frangit
    jejunium.</i>'
</p>

<p>
    "Time and experience," he says further, "have shown that chocolate,
    carefully prepared, is an article of food as wholesome as it is
    agreeable; that it is nourishing, easy of digestion, and does not
    possess those qualities injurious to beauty with which coffee has been
    reproached; that it is excellently adapted to persons who are obliged to
    a great concentration of intellect; in the toils of the pulpit or the
    bar, and especially to travellers; that it suits the most feeble
    stomach; that excellent effects have been produced by it in chronic
    complaints, and that it is a last resource in affections of the pylorus.
</p>

<p>
    "Some persons complain of being unable to digest chocolate; others, on
    the contrary, pretend that it has not sufficient nourishment, and that
    the effect disappears too soon. It is probable that the former have only
    themselves to blame, and that the chocolate which they use is of bad
    quality or badly made; for good and well-made chocolate must suit every
    stomach which retains the slightest digestive power.
</p>

<p>
    "In regard to the others, the remedy is an easy one: they should
    reinforce their breakfast with a <i>pâté</i>, a cutlet, or a kidney, moisten
    the whole with a good draught of soconusco chocolate, and thank God for
    a stomach of such superior activity.
</p>

<p>
    "This gives me an opportunity to make an observation whose accuracy may
    be depended upon.
</p>

<p>
    "After a good, complete, and copious breakfast, if we take, in addition,
    a cup of well-made chocolate, digestion will be perfectly accomplished
    in three hours, and we may dine whenever we like. Out of zeal for
    science, and by dint of eloquence, I have induced many ladies to try
    this experiment. They all declared, in the beginning, that it would kill
    them; but they have all thriven on it and have not failed to glorify
    their teacher.
</p>

<p>
    "The people who make constant use of chocolate are the ones who enjoy
    the most steady health, and are the least subject to a multitude of
    little ailments which destroy the comfort of life; their plumpness is
    also more equal. These are two advantages which every one may verify
    among his own friends, and wherever the practice is in use."
</p>

<p>
    In corroboration of M. Brillat-Savarin's statement as to the value of
    chocolate as an aid to digestion, we may quote from one of Mme. de
    Sévigné's letters to her daughter:
</p>

<p>
    "I took chocolate night before last to digest my dinner, in order to
    have a good supper. I took some yesterday for nourishment, so as to be
    able to fast until night. What I consider amusing about chocolate is
    that it acts according to the wishes of the one who takes it."
</p>

<p>
    Chocolate appears to have been highly valued as a remedial agent by the
    leading physicians of that day. Christoph Ludwig Hoffman wrote a
    treatise entitled, "Potus Chocolate," in which he recommended it in many
    diseases, and instanced the case of Cardinal Richelieu, who, he stated,
    was cured of general atrophy by its use.
</p>

<p>
    A French officer who served in the West Indies for a period of fifteen
    years, during the early part of the last century, wrote, as the result
    of his personal observations, a treatise on "The Natural History of
    Chocolate, Being a distinct and Particular Account of the Cacao Tree,
    its Growth and Culture, and the Preparation, Excellent Properties, and
    Medicinal Virtues of its Fruit," which received the approbation of the
    Regent of the Faculty of Medicine at Paris, and which was translated and
    published in London, in 1730. After describing the different methods of
    raising and curing the fruit and preparing it for food (which it is not
    worth while to reproduce here, as the methods have essentially changed
    since that time), he goes on to demonstrate, as the result of actual
    experiment, that chocolate is a substance "very temperate, very
    nourishing, and of easy digestion; very proper to repair the exhausted
    spirits and decayed strength; and very suitable to preserve the health
    and prolong the lives of old men....
</p>

<p>
    "I could produce several instances," he says, "in favor of this
    excellent nourishment; but I shall content myself with two only, equally
    certain and decisive, in proof of its goodness. The first is an
    experiment of chocolate's being taken for the only nourishment&mdash;made by
    a surgeon's wife of Martinico. She had lost, by a very deplorable
    accident, her lower jaw, which reduced her to such a condition that she
    did not know how to subsist. She was not capable of taking anything
    solid, and not rich enough to live upon jellies and nourishing broths.
    In this strait she determined to take three dishes of chocolate,
    prepared after the manner of the country, one in the morning, one at
    noon, and one at night. There chocolate is nothing else but cocoa
    kernels dissolved in hot water, with sugar, and seasoned with a bit of
    cinnamon. This new way of life succeeded so well that she has lived a
    long while since, more lively and robust than before this accident.
</p>

<p>
    "I had the second relation from a gentleman of Martinico, and one of my
    friends not capable of a falsity. He assured me that in his neighborhood
    an infant of four months old unfortunately lost his nurse, and its
    parents not being able to put it to another, resolved, through
    necessity, to feed it with chocolate. The success was very happy, for
    the infant came on to a miracle, and was neither less healthy nor less
    vigorous than those who are brought up by the best nurses.
</p>

<p>
    "Before chocolate was known in Europe, good old wine was called the milk
    of old men; but this title is now applied with greater reason to
    chocolate, since its use has become so common that it has been perceived
    that chocolate is, with respect to them, what milk is to infants. In
    reality, if one examines the nature of chocolate a little, with respect
    to the constitution of aged persons, it seems as though the one was made
    on purpose to remedy the defects of the other, and that it is truly the
    panacea of old age."
</p>

<p>
    The three associated beverages, cocoa, tea, and coffee are known to the
    French as <i>aromatic</i> drinks. Each of these has its characteristic aroma.
    The fragrance and flavor are so marked that they cannot be imitated by
    any artificial products, although numerous attempts have been made in
    regard to all three. Hence the detection of adulteration is not a
    difficult matter. Designing persons, aware of the extreme difficulty of
    imitating these substances, have undertaken to employ lower grades, and,
    by manipulation, copy, as far as may be, the higher sorts. Every one
    knows how readily tea, and coffee, for that matter, will take up odors
    and flavors from substances placed near them. This is abundantly
    exemplified in the country grocery or general store, where the teas and
    coffees share in the pervasive fragrance of the cheese and kerosene. But
    perhaps it is not so widely understood that some of these very teas and
    coffees had been artificially flavored or corrected before they reached
    their destination in this country.
</p>

<p>
    Cacao lends itself very readily to such preliminary treatment. In a
    first-class article, the beans should be of the highest excellence; they
    should be carefully grown on the plantation and there prepared with
    great skill, arriving in the factory in good condition. In the factory
    they should simply receive the mechanical treatment requisite to
    develop their high and attractive natural flavor and fragrance. They
    should be most carefully shelled after roasting and finely ground
    without concealed additions. This is the process in all honest
    manufactories of the cacao products.
</p>

<p>
    Now, as a matter of fact, in the preparation of many of the cacao
    products on the market, a wholly different course has been pursued.
    Beans of poor quality are used, because of their cheapness, and in some
    instances they are only imperfectly, if at all, shelled before grinding.
    Chemical treatment is relied on to correct in part the odor and taste of
    such inferior goods, and artificial flavors, other than the time-honored
    natural vanilla and the like, are added freely. The detection of such
    imposition is easy enough to the expert, but is difficult to the novice;
    therefore the public is largely unable to discriminate between the good
    and the inferior, and it is perforce compelled to depend almost entirely
    on the character and reputation of the manufacturer.
</p>

<p>
    A distinguished London Physician, in giving some hints concerning the
    proper preparation of cocoa, says:
</p>

<p>
    "Start with a pure cocoa of undoubted quality and excellence of
    manufacture, and which bears the name of a respectable firm. This point
    is important, for there are many cocoas on the market which have been
    doctored by the addition of alkali, starch, malt, kola, hops, etc."
</p>

<p>
    <a href="#baker_breakfast">Baker's Breakfast Cocoa</a> is absolutely pure, and, being ground to an
    extraordinary degree of fineness, is highly soluble. The analyst of the
    Massachusetts State Board of Health states in his recent valuable work
    on "Food Inspection and Analysis," that the treatment of cocoa with
    alkali for the purpose of producing a more perfect emulsion is
    objectionable, even if not considered as a form of adulteration. Cocoa
    thus treated is generally darker in color than the pure article. The
    legitimate means, he says, for making it as soluble as possible is to
    pulverize it very fine, so that particles remain in even suspension and
    form a smooth paste.
</p>

<p>
    That is the way the Baker Cocoa is treated. It has received the Grand
    Prize&mdash;the highest award ever given in this country, and altogether 52
    highest awards in Europe and America.

<h3>
<a name="plain_choc1">PLAIN CHOCOLATE</a>
</h3>

<p>
    For six people, use one quart of milk, two ounces of <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp;
    Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate</a>, one tablespoonful of cornstarch, three
    tablespoonfuls of sugar, and two tablespoonfuls of hot water.
</p>

<p>
    Mix the cornstarch with one gill of the milk. Put the remainder of the
    milk on to heat in the double-boiler. When the milk comes to the boiling
    point, stir in the cornstarch and cook for ten minutes. Have the
    chocolate cut in fine bits, and put it in a small iron or granite-ware
    pan; add the sugar and water, and place the pan over a hot fire. Stir
    constantly until the mixture is smooth and glossy. Add this to the hot
    milk, and beat the mixture with a whisk until it is frothy. Or, the
    chocolate may be poured back and forth from the boiler to a pitcher,
    holding high the vessel from which you pour. This will give a thick
    froth. Serve at once.
</p>

<p>
    If you prefer not to have the chocolate thick, omit the cornstarch. If
    condensed milk is used, substitute water for the milk named above and
    add three tablespoonfuls of condensed milk when the chocolate is added.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="vienna_choc">CHOCOLATE, VIENNA STYLE</a>
</h3>

<p>
    Use four ounces of <a href="#bakers_vanilla_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Vanilla Chocolate</a>, one quart of
    milk, three tablespoonfuls of hot water, and one tablespoonful of sugar.
</p>

<p>
    Cut the chocolate in fine bits. Put the milk on the stove in the
    double-boiler, and when it has been heated to the boiling point, put the
    chocolate, sugar and water in a small iron or granite-ware pan, and stir
    over a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Stir this mixture into the hot
    milk, and beat well with a whisk. Serve at once, putting a tablespoonful
    of whipped cream in each cup and then filling up with the chocolate.
</p>

<p>
    The plain chocolate may be used instead of the vanilla, but in that case
    use a teaspoonful of vanilla extract and three generous tablespoonfuls
    of sugar instead of one.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="breakfast_cocoa">BREAKFAST COCOA</a>
</h3>

<p>
    <a href="#baker_breakfast">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Breakfast Cocoa</a> is powdered so fine that it can be
    dissolved by pouring boiling water on it. For this reason it is often
    prepared at the table. A small teaspoonful of the powder is put in the
    cup with a teaspoonful of sugar; on this is poured two-thirds of a cup
    of boiling water, and milk or cream is added to suit the individual
    taste. This is very convenient; but cocoa is not nearly so good when
    prepared in this manner as when it is boiled.
</p>

<p>
    For six cupfuls of cocoa use two tablespoonfuls of the powder, two
    tablespoonfuls of sugar, half a pint of boiling water, and a pint and a
    half of milk. Put the milk on the stove in the double-boiler. Put the
    cocoa and sugar in a saucepan, and gradually pour the hot water upon
    them, stirring all the time. Place the saucepan on the fire and stir
    until the contents boil. Let this mixture boil for five minutes; then
    add the boiling milk and serve.
</p>

<p>
    A gill of cream is a great addition to this cocoa.
</p>

<p>
    Scalded milk may be used in place of boiled milk, if preferred. For
    flavoring, a few grains of salt and half a teaspoonful of vanilla
    extract may be added.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="choc_layer">CHOCOLATE LAYER CAKE</a>
</h3>

<p>
    Beat half a cupful of butter to a cream, and gradually beat into it one
    cupful of sugar. When this is light, beat in half a cupful of milk, a
    little at a time, and one teaspoonful of vanilla. Beat the whites of six
    eggs to a stiff froth. Mix half a teaspoonful of baking powder with two
    scant cupfuls of sifted flour. Stir the flour and whites of eggs
    alternately into the mixture. Have three deep tin plates well buttered,
    and spread two-thirds of the batter in two of them.
</p>

<p>
    Into the remaining batter stir one ounce of <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Premium
    No. 1 Chocolate</a>, melted, and spread this batter in the third plate. Bake
    the cakes in a moderate oven for about twenty minutes. Put a layer of
    white cake on a large plate, and spread with white icing. Put the dark
    cake on this, and also spread with white icing. On this put the third
    cake. Spread with chocolate icing.
</p>

<p>
    TO MAKE THE ICING. Put into a granite-ware saucepan two gills of sugar
    and one of water, and boil gently until bubbles begin to come from the
    bottom&mdash;say, about five minutes. Take from the fire instantly. Do not
    stir or shake the sugar while it is cooking. Pour the hot syrup in a
    thin stream into the whites of two eggs that have been beaten to a stiff
    froth, beating the mixture all the time. Continue to beat until the
    icing is thick. Flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla. Use two-thirds
    of this as a white icing, and to the remaining third add one ounce of
    melted chocolate. To melt the chocolate, shave it fine and put in a cup,
    which is then to be placed in a pan of boiling water.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="choc_cake">CHOCOLATE CAKE</a>
</h3>

<p>
    For two sheets of cake, use three ounces of <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Premium
    No. 1 Chocolate</a>, three eggs, one cupful and three-fourths of sifted
    pastry flour, one cupful and three-fourths of sugar, half a cupful of
    butter, half a cupful of milk, half a teaspoonful of vanilla extract,
    one teaspoonful and a half of baking powder.
</p>

<p>
    Grate the chocolate. Beat the butter to a cream, and gradually beat in
    the sugar. Beat in the milk and vanilla, then the eggs (already well
    beaten), next the chocolate, and finally the flour, in which the baking
    powder should be mixed. Pour into two well buttered shallow cake pans.
    Bake for twenty-five minutes in a moderate oven. Frost or not, as you
    like.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="choc_marble1">CHOCOLATE MARBLE CAKE</a>
</h3>

<p>
    Put one ounce of <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Chocolate</a> and one tablespoonful of
    butter in a cup, and set this in a pan of boiling water. Beat to a cream
    half a cupful of butter and one cupful of sugar. Gradually beat in half
    a cupful of milk. Now add the whites of six eggs beaten to a stiff
    froth, one teaspoonful of vanilla, and a cupful and a half of sifted
    flour, in which is mixed one teaspoonful of baking powder. Put about
    one-third of this mixture into another bowl, and stir the melted butter
    and chocolate into it. Drop the white-and-brown mixture in spoonfuls
    into a well buttered deep cake pan, and bake in a moderate oven for
    about forty-five minutes; or, the cake can be baked in a sheet and iced
    with a <a href="#choc_icing">chocolate</a> or <a href="#vanilla_icing">white icing</a>.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="choc_glace_cake">CHOCOLATE GLACÉ CAKE</a>
</h3>

<p>
    Beat to a cream a generous half cupful of butter, and gradually beat
    into this one cupful of sugar. Add one ounce of <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s
    Premium No. 1 Chocolate</a>, melted; also two unbeaten eggs. Beat vigorously
    for five minutes; then stir in half a cupful of milk, and lastly, one
    cupful and a half of flour, with which has been mixed one generous
    teaspoonful of baking powder. Flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla.
    Pour into a buttered, shallow cake pan, and bake for half an hour in a
    moderate oven. When cool, spread with <a href="#glace_frosting">glacé frosting</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a name="glace_frosting">GLACÉ FROSTING.</a> Put half a cupful of sugar and three tablespoonfuls of
    water in a small saucepan. Stir over the fire until the sugar is nearly
    melted. Take the spoon from the pan before the sugar really begins to
    boil, because it would spoil the icing if the syrup were stirred after
    it begins to boil. After boiling gently for four minutes, add half a
    teaspoonful of vanilla extract, but do not stir; then set away to cool.
    When the syrup is about blood warm, beat it with a wooden spoon until
    thick and white. Now put the saucepan in another with boiling water, and
    stir until the icing is thin enough to pour. Spread quickly on the cake.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="choc_glace">CHOCOLATE GLACÉ</a>
</h3>

<p>
    After making a <a href="#glace_frosting">glacé frosting</a>, dissolve one ounce of
    <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate</a> in a
    cup, and put it with the frosting, adding also a tablespoonful of boiling water.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="choc_biscuit">CHOCOLATE BISCUIT</a>
</h3>

<p>
    Cover three large baking pans with paper that has been well oiled with
    washed butter. Over these dredge powdered sugar. Melt in a cup one ounce
    of <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate</a>. Separate the whites and
    yolks of four eggs. Add to the yolks a generous half cupful of powdered
    sugar, and beat until light and firm. Add the melted chocolate, and beat
    a few minutes longer. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff, dry froth.
    Measure out three-fourths of a cupful of sifted flour, and stir it and
    the whites into the yolks. The whites and flour must be cut in as
    lightly as possible, and with very little stirring. Drop the mixture in
    teaspoonfuls on the buttered paper. Sprinkle powdered sugar over the
    cakes, and bake in a slow oven for about fourteen or fifteen minutes.
    The mixture can be shaped like lady fingers, if preferred.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="choc_wafers">CHOCOLATE WAFERS</a>
</h3>

<p>
    Grate four ounces of <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate</a>, and
    mix with it two tablespoonfuls of flour and one-fourth of a teaspoonful
    each of cinnamon, cloves and baking powder. Separate six eggs. Add one
    cupful of powdered sugar to the yolks, and beat until very light; then
    add the grated yellow rind and the juice of half a lemon, and beat five
    minutes longer. Now add the dry mixture, and with a spoon lightly cut in
    the whites, which are first to be beaten to a stiff froth. Pour the
    mixture into buttered shallow pans, having it about half an inch thick.
    Bake in a moderate oven for half an hour. When the cake is cool, spread
    a thin layer of currant jelly over one sheet, and place the other sheet
    on this. Ice with <a href="#vanilla_icing">vanilla icing</a>; and when this hardens, cut in squares.
    It is particularly nice to serve with ice-cream.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="cinderella">CINDERELLA CAKES</a>
</h3>

<p>
    Use two eggs, one cupful of sugar, one cupful and a quarter of flour,
    one gill of cold water, one tablespoonful of lemon juice, one
    teaspoonful of baking powder, one ounce of <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Premium
    No. 1 Chocolate</a>, half a tumbler of any kind of jelly, and <a href="#eclair_icing">chocolate
    icing</a> the same as for <a href="#choc_eclairs">éclairs</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Separate the eggs, and beat the yolks and sugar together until light.
    Beat the whites until light, and then beat them with yolks and sugar and
    grated chocolate. Next beat in the lemon juice and water, and finally
    the flour, in which the baking powder should be mixed. Beat for three
    minutes, and then pour the batter into two pans, and bake in a moderate
    oven for about eighteen minutes. When done, spread one sheet of cake
    with the jelly, and press the other sheet over it; and when cold, cut
    into little squares and triangular pieces. Stick a wooden toothpick into
    each of these pieces and dip each one into the hot icing, afterwards
    removing the toothpick, of course.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="choc_eclairs">CHOCOLATE ÉCLAIRS</a>
</h3>

<p>
    Into a granite-ware saucepan put half a pint of milk, two well-rounded
    tablespoonfuls of butter, and one tablespoonful of sugar, and place on
    the stove. When this boils up, add half a pint of sifted flour, and cook
    for two minutes, beating well with a wooden spoon. It will be smooth and
    velvety at the end of that time. Set away to cool; and when cool, beat
    in four eggs, one at a time. Beat vigorously for about fifteen minutes.
    Try a small bit of the paste in the oven; and if it rises in the form of
    a hollow ball, the paste is beaten enough; whereas, if it does not, beat
    a little longer. Have tin sheets or shallow pans slightly buttered. Have
    ready, also, a tapering tin tube, with the smaller opening about
    three-quarters of an inch in diameter. Place this in the small end of a
    conical cotton pastry bag. Put the mixture in the bag, and press out on
    buttered pans, having each éclair nearly three inches long. There should
    be eighteen, and they must be at least two inches apart, as they swell
    in cooking. Bake in a moderately hot oven for about twenty-five minutes.
    Take from the oven, and while they are still warm coat them with
    chocolate. When cold, cut open on the side, and fill with either of the
    following described preparations:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
    <a name="eclairs_filling1">FILLING NO. 1.</a>&mdash;Mix in a bowl half a pint of rich cream, one teaspoonful
    of vanilla, and four tablespoonfuls of sugar. Place the bowl in a pan of
    ice-water, and beat the cream until light and firm, using either an
    egg-beater or a whisk.
</p>

<p>
    FILLING NO. 2.&mdash;Put half a pint of milk into a double-boiler, and place
    on the fire. Beat together until very light one level tablespoonful of
    flour, half a cupful of sugar, and one egg. When the milk boils, stir in
    this mixture. Add one-eighth of a teaspoonful of salt, and cook for
    fifteen minutes, stirring often. When cold, flavor with one teaspoonful
    of vanilla.
</p>

<p>
<a name="eclair_icing">ICING FOR ÉCLAIRS.</a>&mdash;Put in a small granite-ware pan half a pint of sugar
    and five tablespoonfuls of cold water. Stir until the sugar is
    partially melted, and then place on the stove, stirring for half a
    minute. Take out the spoon, and watch the sugar closely. As soon as it
    boils, take instantly from the fire and pour upon a meat-platter. Let
    this stand for eight minutes. Meantime, shave into a cup one ounce of
    <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate</a>, and put it on the fire in
    a pan of boiling water. At the end of eight minutes stir the sugar with
    a wooden spoon until it begins to grow white and to thicken. Add the
    melted chocolate quickly, and continue stirring until the mixture is
    thick. Put it in a small saucepan, and place on the fire in another pan
    of hot water. Stir until so soft that it will pour freely. Stick a
    skewer into the side of an éclair, and dip the top in the hot chocolate.
    Place on a plate, and continue until all the éclairs are "glacéd." They
    will dry quickly. Do not stir the sugar after the first half minute, and
    do not scrape the sugar from the saucepan into the platter. All the
    directions must be strictly followed.

<h3>
<a name="choc_cookies">CHOCOLATE COOKIES</a>
</h3>

<p>
    Beat to a cream half a cupful of butter and one tablespoonful of lard.
    Gradually beat into this one cupful of sugar; then add one-fourth of a
    teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, and two ounces of
    <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate</a>, melted. Now add one
    well-beaten egg, and half a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in two
    tablespoonfuls of milk. Stir in about two cupfuls and a half of flour.
    Roll thin, and, cutting in round cakes, bake in a rather quick oven. The
    secret of making good cookies is the use of as little flour as will
    suffice.

    of salt. Dissolve one teaspoonful of soda in a teaspoonful of cold
    water; add this and two tablespoonfuls of melted butter to the mixture.
    Now stir in two cupfuls of sifted flour, and finally add two ounces of
    <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Chocolate</a> and one tablespoonful of butter, melted

<p>
    As soon as the paste is cooked, beat in the melted chocolate. When cold,
    add the eggs, and beat until light. Drop this batter on lightly buttered
    pans in round cakes, having about a dessertspoonful in each cake. Bake
    for about twenty minutes in a moderately hot oven. Serve either hot or
    cold, with whipped cream prepared the same as for <a href="#eclairs_filling1">Filling No. 1 for

    Add to this a gill of hot milk and the soaked gelatine, and stir until
    the gelatine is dissolved. Sprinkle a generous half cupful of powdered
    sugar over the cream. Now add the chocolate and gelatine mixture, and
    stir gently until it begins to thicken. Line a quart charlotte-mould
    with lady fingers, and when the cream is so thick that it will just
    pour, turn it gently into the mould. Place the charlotte in a cold
    place for an hour or more, and, at serving time, turn out on a flat
    dish.

    until a few drops of it will harden if dropped into ice-water; then pour
    into well-buttered pans, having the mixture about three-fourths of an
    inch deep. When nearly cold, mark into squares. It will take almost an
    hour to boil this in a granite-ware pan, but not half so long if cooked

<h3>
<a name="choc_creams1">CHOCOLATE CREAMS, No. 1</a>
</h3>

<p>
    Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth. Gradually beat into this
    two cupfuls of confectioners' sugar. If the eggs be large, it may take a
    little more sugar. Flavor with half a teaspoonful of vanilla, and work
    well. Now roll into little balls, and drop on a slightly buttered
    platter. Let the balls stand for an hour or more. Shave five ounces of
    <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate</a> and put into a small bowl,
    which place on the fire in a saucepan containing boiling water. When the
    chocolate is melted, take the saucepan to the table, and drop the creams
    into the chocolate one at a time, taking them out with a fork and
    dropping them gently on the buttered dish. It will take half an hour or
    more to harden the chocolate.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="choc_creams2">CHOCOLATE CREAMS, No. 2</a>
</h3>

<p>
    For these creams you should make a fondant in this way: put into a
    granite-ware saucepan one cupful of water and two of granulated
    sugar&mdash;or a pound of loaf sugar. Stir until the sugar is nearly melted,
    then place on the fire and heat slowly, but do not stir the mixture.
    Watch carefully and note when it begins to boil. When the sugar has been
    boiling for ten minutes, take up a little of it and drop in ice-water.
    If it hardens enough to form a soft ball when rolled between the thumb
    and finger, it is cooked enough. Take the saucepan from the fire
    instantly, and set in a cool, dry place. When the syrup is so cool that
    the finger can be held in it comfortably, pour it into a bowl, and stir
    with a wooden spoon until it becomes thick and white. When it begins to
    look dry, and a little hard, take out the spoon, and work with the hand
    until the cream is soft and smooth. Flavor with a few drops of vanilla,
    and, after shaping, cover with chocolate, as directed in the <a href="#choc_creams1">preceding
    recipe</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Caution.</i>&mdash;Do not stir the syrup while it is cooking, and be careful
    not to jar or shake the saucepan.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="choc_cones">CHOCOLATE CONES</a>
</h3>

<p>
    Boil the sugar as directed for fondant in the recipe for <a href="#choc_creams2">Chocolate
    Creams, No. 2</a>, but not quite so long&mdash;say about eleven minutes. The
    syrup, when tested, should be too soft to ball. When cold, pour into a
    bowl, and beat until thick and creamy. If properly boiled, it will not
    become thick enough to work with the hands.
</p>

<p>
    Have six ounces of <a href="#bakers_choc">Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s Premium No. 1 Chocolate</a> melted
    in a bowl. Pour half of the creamed sugar into another bowl, and, after
    flavoring with a few drops of vanilla, add to it about one-third of the
    dissolved chocolate. Stir until thick and rather dry; then make into
    small cones, and drop on a slightly buttered platter. Put half of the
    remaining creamed sugar in a cup, and set in a saucepan containing
    boiling water. Flavor with vanilla, and stir over the fire until melted
    so much that it will pour from the spoon. Take the saucepan to the table
    and dip one-half the cones in, one at a time, just as the <a href="#choc_creams1">Chocolate
    Creams, No. 1</a>, were dipped in the melted chocolate. If liked, a second
    coating may be given the cones. Now put the remainder of the creamed
    sugar on to melt, and add two tablespoonfuls of hot water to it. Stir
    the remainder of the melted chocolate into this, and if too thick to dip
    the candy in, add hot water, a few drops at a time, until the mixture is
    of the right consistency; then dip the rest of the cones in this.

    cream, one gill of milk, and half a gill of soda-water from a syphon
    bottle, or Apollinaris water. Stir well before drinking. A tablespoonful
    of vanilla ice-cream is a desirable addition. It is a delicious drink,
    even if the soda or Apollinaris water and ice-cream be omitted. A
    plainer drink is made by combining the syrup, a gill and a half of milk,
    and the ice, shaking well.

<h3>
<a name="choc_suggestions">A FEW SUGGESTIONS IN REGARD TO CHOCOLATE</a>
</h3>

<p>
    The best flavor to add to chocolate is vanilla; next to that, cinnamon.
    Beyond these two things one should use great caution, as it is very easy
    to spoil the fine natural flavor of the bean. Chocolate absorbs odors
    readily; therefore it should be kept in a pure, sweet atmosphere. As
    about eleven per cent. of the chocolate bean is starch, chocolate and
    cocoa are of a much finer flavor if boiled for a few minutes. Long
    boiling, however, ruins their flavor and texture.

<ul>
<li>6 tablespoonfuls of butter,</li>
<li>&frac34; cup of sugar (scant),</li>
<li>1 egg,</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of milk,</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of vanilla or pinch of cinnamon,</li>
<li>5 teaspoonfuls of <a href="#soluble_cocoa">Baker's Cocoa</a>,</li>
<li>1/8 teaspoonful of baking powder,</li>
<li>1 &frac14; to 1 &frac12; cups of sifted pastry flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Cream the butter until soft; add the sugar gradually and beat well; add
    the beaten egg, milk and vanilla; mix thoroughly. Sift cocoa, baking
    powder, and a pinch of salt with about one-half cup of the flour; stir
    this into the mixture first, then use the remainder of the flour, and
    more if necessary, to make a firm dough that will not stick to the
    fingers. Set on the ice to harden. Sprinkle the board with cocoa and a
    very little sugar. Use small pieces of the dough at a time, toss it over
    the board to prevent sticking, roll out thin, cut in strips about
    one-half inch wide and three inches long. Place closely in pan and bake
    in moderately hot oven three or four minutes. Great care should be taken
    in the baking to prevent burning.
</p>

<p>
    It is advisable to gather the scraps after each rolling, if soft, and
    set away to harden, for fear of getting in too much cocoa, thus making
    them bitter.
</p>

<p>
    The colder and harder the dough is, the better it can be handled;
    therefore it can be made the day before using.

<li>About 1 &frac34; cups of confectioners' sugar.</li>

    Put the cocoa in a small saucepan; add the cold water and stir until
    perfectly smooth; then the hot water, and cook for one or two minutes,
    add vanilla and a speck of salt, then stir in enough sugar to make it
    stiff enough to spread nicely. Beat until smooth and glossy and free
    from lumps.
</p>

<p>
    If too thick, add a little cold water. If not thick enough, add a little
    sugar. Never make a frosting so stiff that it will have to be made
    smooth with a wet knife. It is better to let it run to the sides of the
    cake. For frosting sides of the cake, make a little stiffer.

<a name="coating_candies">HOW TO COAT CANDIES, &amp;c., WITH BAKER'S "DOT" CHOCOLATE</a>
</h3>

<p>
    Half a pound of <a href="#dot_choc">"Dot" Chocolate</a> will coat quite a number of candy or
    other "centers," but as depth of chocolate and an even temperature
    during the whole time one is at work are essential, it is well, when
    convenient, to melt a larger quantity of chocolate. When cold, the
    unused chocolate may be cut from the dish and set aside for use at a
    future time. If the chocolate be at the proper temperature when the
    centers are dipped in it, it will give a rich, glossy coating free from
    spots, and the candies will not have a spreading base. After a few
    centers have been dipped set them in a cool place to harden. The
    necessary utensils are a wire fork and a very small double boiler. The
    inner dish of the boiler should be of such size that the melted
    chocolate will come nearly to the top of it. Break the chocolate in
    small pieces and surround with warm water, stir occasionally while
    melting. When the melted chocolate has cooled to about 80° F. it is
    ready to use. Drop whatever is to be coated into the chocolate, with the
    fork push it below the chocolate, lift out, draw across the edge of the
    dish and drop onto a piece of table oil cloth or onto waxed paper. Do
    not let a drop of water get into the chocolate.

    used. Use three tablespoonfuls of syrup and one tablespoonful of water
    with one egg white instead of the two tablespoonfuls of water indicated
    in the recipe). Work the fondant for some time, then break off little
    bits and wrap around small pieces of the fruit, then roll in the hollow
    of the hand into balls or oblongs. For other candies, roll a piece of
    the fondant into a ball, flatten it with the fingers and use to cover a
    whole pecan or English walnut meat. Set each shape on a plate as it is
    finished. They will harden very quickly. Dip these, one by one, in

    cold water, wash down the sides of the saucepan, to remove any grains of
    sugar that have been thrown there. Cover the saucepan and let boil
    rapidly three or four minutes. Remove the cover, set in the
    thermometer&mdash;if one is to be used&mdash;and let cook very rapidly to 240° F.,
    or the soft ball degree. Wet the hand in cold water and with it dampen a
    marble slab or a large platter, then without jarring the syrup turn it
    onto the marble or platter. Do not scrape out the saucepan or allow the
    last of the syrup to drip from it, as sugary portions will spoil the
    fondant by making it grainy. When the syrup is cold, with a metal
    scraper or a wooden spatula, turn the edges of the mass towards the
    center, and continue turning the edges in until the mass begins to
    thicken and grow white, then work it up into a ball, scraping all the
    sugar from the marble onto the mass; knead slightly, then cover closely
    with a heavy piece of cotton cloth wrung out of cold water. Let the
    sugar stand for an hour or longer to ripen, then remove the damp cloth
    and cut the mass into pieces; press these closely into a kitchen bowl,
    cover with a cloth wrung out of water (this cloth must not touch the
    fondant) and then with heavy paper. The fondant may be used the next
    day, but is in better condition after several days, and may be kept
    almost indefinitely, if the cloth covering it be wrung out of cold water
    and replaced once in five or six days. Fondant may be used, white or
    delicately colored with vegetable color-pastes or with chocolate, as
    frosting for small cakes, or éclairs or for making candy "centers," to
    be coated with chocolate or with some of the same fondant tinted and

    Mix the chopped almonds with the fondant and vanilla; add confectioner's
    sugar, a little at a time, and knead the mass thoroughly, on a marble or
    large platter; shape into a long roll, then cut into small pieces of the
    same size. Shape these into balls a generous half inch in diameter and
    leave them about an hour to harden on the outside. Put the fondant for
    the coating and the chocolate (shaved or broken in pieces) in a double
    boiler (with hot water in the lower receptacle); add the vanilla and the
    water and heat until melted; take out the spoon and put in a dipping
    fork (a wire fork costing about ten cents) beat the fondant, to keep it
    from crusting and drop in a "center;" with the fork cover it with
    fondant; put the fork under it and lift it out, scrape the fork lightly
    on the edge of the dish, to remove superfluous candy, turn the fork over
    and drop the bon-bon onto waxed paper. Make a design with the fork in
    taking it from the candy. At once press half of a blanched almond on the
    top of the candy, or the design made with the fork will suffice. If at
    any time the coating be too thick, add a few drops of water. If any be
    left over, use it to coat whole nuts or cherries.

<p>
    Many candies, especially such as are of some variety of <a href="#fondant">fondant</a>, are
    thin when warm and solidify on the outside when cold, so that they may
    be "dipped" or <a href="#coating_candies">coated with chocolate</a>. To shape candy of this sort, fill
    a low pan with cornstarch, making it smooth upon the top. Have ready
    molds made of plaster paris, glued to a thin strip of wood, press these
    into the cornstarch; lift from the starch and repeat the impressions as
    many times as the space allows. If molds are not available a thimble,
    round piece of wood, or the stopper of an oil or vinegar cruet will
    answer the purpose, though the impressions must be made one at a time.

    ESTABLISHED 1780

<p>
    This House has grown to be the largest of its kind in the world and it
    has achieved that result by always maintaining the highest standard in
    the quality of its cocoa and chocolate preparations and selling them at
    the lowest price for which unadulterated articles of high grade can be
    put upon the market. Under cover of a similarity in name, trade-mark,
    label or wrapper, a number of unscrupulous concerns have, within recent
    years, made attempts to get possession of the great market won by this
    House, by trading on its good name&mdash;selling to unsuspecting consumers
    goods of distinctly inferior quality by representing them to be the
    products of the genuine "Baker's." The quantity of goods sold in this
    way is not so much of an injury to us as the discredit cast upon our
    manufactures by leading some consumers to believe that these fraudulent
    articles are of our manufacture and that we have lowered the high
    standard maintained for so many years. It is difficult to bring the
    fraud home to all consumers, as those who are making use of it seek
    out-of-the-way places where deception will the more easily pass.
</p>

<p>
    We have letters from housekeepers who have used the genuine Baker goods
    for years, expressing their indignation at the attempts of unscrupulous
    dealers to foist upon them inferior and adulterated articles by
    fraudulently representing them to be of our manufacture.
</p>

<p>
    Statements in the press and in the reports of the Pure Food
    Commissioners show that there are on the market at this time many cocoas
    and chocolates which have been treated with adulterants, more or less
    injurious to health, for the purpose of cheapening the cost and giving a
    fictitious appearance of richness and strength. The safest course for
    consumers, therefore, is to buy goods bearing the name and trade-mark of
    a well-known and reputable manufacturer, and to make sure by a careful
    examination that they are getting what they order.
</p>

<blockquote>
     <b>Our Cocoa and Chocolate Preparations are ABSOLUTELY PURE&mdash;free
     from coloring matter, chemical solvents, or adulterants of any
     kind, and are therefore in full conformity to the requirements of
     all National and State Pure Food Laws.</b>
</blockquote>

<p>
    We have behind us one hundred and twenty-nine years of successful
    manufacture, and fifty-two highest awards from the great industrial
    exhibitions in Europe and America.
</p>

<p>
    We ask the cooperation of all consumers who want to get what they order
    and what they pay for to help us&mdash;as much in their own interest as
    ours&mdash;in checking these frauds.

    This admirable preparation is made from selected cocoa, from which the
    excess of oil has been removed. It is <i>absolutely pure</i>, and it is
    <i>soluble</i>. It has <i>more than three times the strength</i> of cocoa mixed
    with starch, arrowroot or sugar, and is, therefore, far more economical,
    <i>costing less than one cent a cup</i>. It is delicious, nourishing,
    strengthening, <i>easily digested</i>, and admirably adapted for invalids as
    well as for persons in health.
</p>

<p>
    <i>No alkalies or other chemicals or dyes are used in its preparation.</i>

    It is the pure product of carefully selected cocoa beans, to which
    nothing has been added and from which nothing has been taken away.
    Unequalled for smoothness, delicacy and natural flavor. Celebrated for
    more than a century as a nutritious, delicious and flesh-forming
    beverage. The high reputation and constantly increasing sales of this
    article have led to imitations on a very extensive scale. To distinguish
    their product from these imitations Walter Baker &amp; Co., Ltd., have
    enclosed their cakes and pound packages in a new envelope or case of
    stiff paper, different from any other package. The color of the case is
    the same shade of deep blue heretofore used on the Baker packages, and
    no change has been made in the color (yellow) and design of the label.
    On the outside of the case, the name of the manufacturer is prominently
    printed in white letters. On the back of every package a colored
    lithograph of the trade-mark, "La Belle Chocolatière" sometimes called
    the Chocolate Girl, is printed. Vigorous proceedings will be taken
    against anyone imitating the package.

    trial will convince one that it is really a delicious article for eating
    or drinking. It is the best sweet chocolate in the market. Used at
    receptions and evening parties in place of tea or coffee. The small
    cakes form the most convenient, palatable and healthful article of food
    that can be carried by bicyclists, tourists and students.

    In "The Way of the Woods&mdash;A Manual for Sportsmen" Edward Breck, the
    author, says:
</p>

<blockquote>
    "Chocolate is now regarded as a very high-class food on account of its
    nutritive qualities. * * * * * A half cake will keep a man's strength up
    for a day without any other food. I never strike off from camp by myself
    without a piece of chocolate in my pocket. Do not, however, have
    anything to do with the mawkishly sweet chocolates of the candy shops or
    the imported milk chocolate, which are not suited for the purpose. We
    have something better here in America in Walter Baker &amp; Co.'s "Dot"
    brand, which is slightly sweetened."

    This is the freshly roasted bean cracked into small pieces. It contains
    no admixture, and presents the full flavor of the cocoa-bean in all its
    natural fragrance and purity. When properly prepared, it is one of the

<p>
    One-half the weight of the cocoa-bean consists of a fat called
    "cocoa-butter," from its resemblance to ordinary butter. It is
    considered of great value as a nutritious, strengthening tonic, being
    preferred to cod-liver oil and other nauseous fats so often used in
    pulmonary complaints. As a soothing application to chapped hands and
    lips, and all irritated surfaces, cocoa-butter has no equal, making the
    skin remarkably soft and smooth. Many who have used it say they would
    not for any consideration be without it. It is almost a necessary
    article for every household.

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
